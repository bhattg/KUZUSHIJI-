# KUZUSHIJI- MNIST
A Deep Convolutional Neural Networks based classifier to classify old Japanese script.
## Dataset Review
Kuzushiji-MNIST is a drop-in replacement for the MNIST dataset (28x28 grayscale, 70,000 images), provided in the original MNIST format as well as a NumPy format. Since MNIST restricts us to 10 classes, we chose one character to represent each of the 10 rows of Hiragana when creating Kuzushiji-MNIST.
### Our results
By non resnet architectures, we were able to achieve the accuracy of **97.18%**.
